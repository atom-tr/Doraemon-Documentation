## How do I create the pending confession channel?

Type the command `catcn cfsp` in the channel that you want to setup.

{% hint style="info" %}
_Note: This command is only available for **Guild Premium**_
{% endhint %}

## As a server owner, is there a way to know who wrote the anonymous confessions?

**We do not provide any user information about confessions to any servers.**

If you need help with reporting some **serious** cases to discord, we can handle that!

Btw, you can upgrade to **Guild Premium** to access Pending channel, where you can decide which one will be posted on confession channel.

## How do I make a channel and assign it for word story

See `cathelp channel` and setup your channel, for example: `catchannel ows`

{% hint style="info" %}
Use **`cathelp channel`** for more info
{% endhint %}

## How do I reset the counting channel?

`catcn reset`

## Is there any purge or nuke command?

`catclean {number}`
